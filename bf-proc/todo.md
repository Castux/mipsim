# TODO

- List exactly all the phases for each instruction
- Write data in a spreadsheet that mimics the op decoder
	- left columns are ops and phases
	- right columns are switches
	- each line selects an op and a phase on the left using A and B and not C type of logic (factor those that are in common)
	- each line give as output the status of all switches in the processor to perform the op at the given phase
- Possibly write a script that turns this spreadsheet into the decoder tiles, to be less error prone and more efficient
